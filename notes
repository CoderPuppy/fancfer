patch based thing, see Pijul
location tracking, see git-annex
split information between drives
filesystem help for keeping the "index" up to date, see VFSforGit and Scalar
content aware chunking
tree based hashing: see Blake3

checking for changes
	keep backbackrefs from the targets of backrefs to the backrefs
	if something within the target is updated, make sure the backref is checked as well
	these can appear just inside backheads, i.e. not inside a source's value
	so directories, files and unrealized
operations
	{,un}realize, copy {up,down} {from,to}

	simultaneously descend multiple trees
		handles copying
		TODO: {,un}realize

		how to handle backbackrefs?
			delay the tree, handle when all parts are ready
			requires delaying dependencies as well

		how to record where all the places are?

		I think this is completely infeasible (at least with down arrows)
